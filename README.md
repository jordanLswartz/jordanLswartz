I recently co-created [Triage](https://team-triage.github.io/), an open-source consumer proxy that handles head-of-line-blocking through parallelism and and a dead letter store.

Triage was built with Go, Apache Kafa, and a few flavors of AWS.

If you'd like to learn more about Triage, please see the [case study](https://team-triage.github.io/case-study).
